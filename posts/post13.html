  <p>The end of last week and the start of this week has been focused on correcting some implementation of a step editor for sending an HTTP(S) web request. Ryan, my co-worker and fellow work study student, over the past couple months been working on a method to send HTTP requests to other services and other Darklight instances as a core feature requested from out CTO and former senior developer Peter to help gather contextual information from third party sources and for the Darklight instances communicate via package context. We needed a step editor to do formal integration testing of the feature, which was put together rather quickly with several bugs that prevented useful interaction, so I have taken on the responsibility to refactor and clean up the step editor.</p>
  <p>Since I have just finished the statistics step editor using the toolkit, which is becoming more useful as I work, I had a good method of integration with this editor since it also uses the same toolkit API. It is being used in the web request step editor, however, not in a way that is consistent with the other step editors using the toolkit. So first thing was first, clean up the layout of the rendered elements and remove any code that was unnecessarily put into functions so that to make the flow of the code easier to read.</p>
  <p>Next, I needed to find the original bug that lead me to the editor to fix. At the time of simplifying code, I removed all the event listeners for the elements so that I could start from scratch. Doing this allowed me to redo the logic of text checks and other validation. Along the way, I commented segments that were not apparently clear by reading through code. Again, this was for consistency in code, where multiple event listeners that needed to validate the same way, did not have different code implementations.</p>
  <p>Today I was able to test and confirm that the step editor saved the proper configurations and held its state when reloaded, marking this as a complete refactor for Ian to begin testing as we get ready to release the next version of Darklight in the next week or two.</p>
