  <h3>Post 9: 4/8/2018</h3>
  <p>This past week or so has been a hodgepodge of many small tasks not necessarily contributing to any major portion of the code; testing a develop branch where a significant API refactor is occurring, helping to identify bugs and/or fix them if it seemed possible with what understanding I had, fixing bugs on our current feature branch, taking on tasks that were previously owned by one of our senior developers, Peter, who is currently on the outbound.</p>
  <p>One of Peter’s more major tasks was to develop on a scenario and be directly involved with a potential high value contract that we have been working towards for the past several months, and hopefully will be gaining traction soon. Because of the high value, it is a task that needs to be worked on constantly, incorporating API’s understanding data, and possible behavior of the contractors. My supervisor, Ryan, has given much of the responsibility to continue the development portion of the task, so that if and when the contract takes place, we will have a significant understanding of how we can integrate their API with our product.</p>
  <p>Ian has been going through an extensive round of testing so that we can make due on our current feature branch and get our next release of the software out. While this has been going, I have been fixing the minor bugs. You could say I am on the call for bug duty. Some of these bugs have been in features that I have written, which is kind of embarrassing and frustrating because I had the understanding that my code would work through and through (junior mistake of course). So what I take away from that is, unit testing and other mechanisms of assurance should be a higher priority in the future.</p>
