  <p>This week I will be focusing on finishing up an enhancement of the statistic feature in Darklight. With the current state of the feature, the step will only return one value (of the eight provided: 1st quartile, 3rd quartile, max, min, mean, mode, median, standard deviation). When you are wanting to know a lot of statistical facts about a set of data, this implementation is rather cumbersome and cluttering if you want even half of the statistics on a single data set. And it seemed rather redundant to create 3 or 4 steps to get a statistic from a single data set when the rest of the configuration is set the same, and the possibly of wanting this data from multiple data sets creates even more clutter in a chain. I explained this on my last post.</p>
  <p>So now with the enhancements being put in place, it is easy to see the value. What I decided to do was use the Java FormToolkit API, built with SWT. The toolkit is used for user interfaces that are more form and data driven so it has neat features such as section definitions and collapsing of titled sections. The layout mechanism is actually simpler than plain SWT so I have to right less code than if writing this in the latter. I actually do not think that you can do some of the things in SWT that the toolkit does, or maybe it does but would take a lot of work to implement (how APIâ€™s are birthed). </p>
  <p>At the end of last week, I was getting my feet dirty into the toolkit and started switching out some of the fields that would be replaced by the new stuff, which I have not explained yet. The current design has two fields of importance; the statistic you want extracted from the data set and the output variable name of that statistic. In the toolkit, there is a section class that can be used to create collapsible sections that hide child elements.</p>
  <p>The easier part of this was putting those two elements into a section and calling it good, however, that was only one part of the problem. These sections needed to be dynamic in the sense that you can add and remove sections based on statistics that you want to output. And not only that, but sections that exist should not have the add button in the section if it is not the last section in the list, so there is state dependent rendering of these elements. This week will be the solving of that problem.</p>
