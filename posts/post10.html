  <p>This past week has not been very eventful production wise for me. This week one of our core developers is leaving to a new job. So much of the time this week has been verifying things that he needs to pass on to other team members that he managed and worked on. For me, this included the testing code he put together for a possible replacement of our JPA implementation with a NoSQL database called NitriteDB that is a document database, much like MongoDB but with the easy to use embedded API so that a server does not need to be instantiated. We were thinking of doing this as the Derby database that we use is expensive and the JPA layer does not improve on this. So having a fast NoSQL database that can be written to file makes it easier to distribute.</p>
  <p>The other major meeting we had included a review of the semantic code base that is the nerve system of our sense making features that Peter had also wrote. As we continue to develop Darklight into the machine learning system that it intends to be, this semantic code will be crucial in being maintained and fixed as need be.</p>
