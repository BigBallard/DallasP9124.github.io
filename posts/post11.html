  <p>The beginning of this week started off with really getting into the new code base that I have previously not been part of. There are some older features that we needed to debug and fix and some newer ones that needed to be developed more while the developer that originally wrote them is off on vacation.</p>
  <p>Alex, our architect, has been working on a feature called the Cyber Effects Matrix (CEM) that maps out playbooks to Mitre’s ATT&CK matrix. The intent is for users of Darklight the ability to see what portions of the matrix that their playbooks are covering, giving them a better understanding of the vulnerabilities covered in their environment. At least the ones that may apply to them or are a serious threat to their enterprise or environment.</p>
  <p>Our Chief Data Officer (CDO) Shawn Riley was given the impression that the CEM was finished and part of the software when Ian showed him the UI design screenshot… from photoshop. So for that past month, Alex has been working on the feature with the impression on Shawn. Long story short, Shawn was not happy when he found out this last weekend that the feature was not actually complete but partial. Naturally we got into hurry mode and I was thrown into the fire in an attempt to read over what Alex had done and see where things needed to be picked up.</p>
  <p>Monday involved loading in the second portion of data that we used from Mitre to load the view. Thankfully this only required the addition of a loop and array of file references that should be loaded. This got the data into memory but we noticed some odd behavior of the code duplicating some fields without the files actually containing them. Some further investigation narrowed down the problem to the table API we used to create the view. This far beyond my understanding and was left to Alex who actually took the time on his vacation to fix. The dude is a genius.</p>
  <p>With that out of the way I was able to continue on the extension of the statistics feature discussed last week with Ian and Peter. Right now the statistics step only outputs one statistic for you that you would select from a dropdown menu of available outputs. There is a playbook that Ian and another intern were working on that needed to determine if the value ini question was an outlier to the dataset. To do this required 3 instances of the statistics step getting the needed values. This is when Ian came to me with the idea that we break out of the value(s) go in, one values comes out paradigm that playbook steps tend to follow, and give the option for the step to return any of the needed statistics. So rather than it return on the mean or standard deviation or whatever in multiple steps, it will return any desired values.</p>
  <p>The core task this week is to get that implemented as soon as possible so that it can be put into our next release coming up soon. This will not require few backend changes on the server but will require a complete refactor of the client side code because of the rendering API needed to display the options appropriately. Visually it will not change much but the code rewrite is the time consuming portion.</p>
